## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnthonyInthavong](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnthonyInthavong)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnthonyInthavong/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Monitoring Agent within the Linux cluster to collect information such as hardware specifications and resource usage on nodes within the cluster. This Monitoring Agent contains a PostgreSQL Server installed within a Docker Container that collects information submitted via bash scripts installed on each node.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnthonyInthavong/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed Twitter API using CRD operations following a MVC architecture in Java 1.8. Followed Repository Design pattern to manage data flow by using DTO's and DAO. Spring Framework was implemented to manage object dependencies.
  - JDBC App: This application is a demonstration of the DAO and Repository Design patterns being implemented using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). Basic CRUD operations were implemented.
  - Grep App: Implemented a simple grep application built using Java 1.8 and Java Stream API. The app searches for a regex text pattern recursively in a given directory and outputs the matched lines to files. This application was Dockerized for easy distribution.
